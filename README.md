Notion’s ability to embed other web pages is a kind of a superpower really.
This page is my collection of Notion Widgets that I have created or modified over the years.
Most of these widgets were created for a special purpose and are not your out of the box regular widgets.
Clicking any of these widgets will take you to the widget page where you can see it in life preview, get a link of it to embed it in your Notion page and (sometimes) learn how to customize it.
